**The Peter Principle Revisited: A Computational Study**

*Alessandro Pluchino, Andrea Rapisarda, Cesare Garofalo*

Here we show, by means of agent based simulations, that if the [hypotheses] actually hold in a given model of an organization with a hierarchical structure, then not only is the Peter principle unavoidable, but also it yields in turn a significant reduction of the global efficiency of the organization. Within a game theory-like approach, we explore different promotion strategies and we find, counterintuitively, that in order to avoid such an effect the best ways for improving the efficiency of a given organization are either to promote each time an agent at random or to promote randomly the best and the worst members in terms of competence.
